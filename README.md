# CESA : Chebyshev Polynomials based Efficient and Secure Access Authentication Scheme

## Overview
CESAbis a novel authentication mechanism designed for both UE and mMTC devices over 5G networks. This scheme leverages Chebyshev polynomials to enhance security and efficiency in authentication procedures.

This repository provides all necessary files for security protocol verification using ProVerif and Scyther tools. 

## Tool Used

- ProVerif: A formal verification tool for security protocols, used to analyze cryptographic protocols and ensure their robustness against attacks.

- Scyther: A tool for the automated verification of security protocols, focusing on symbolic security analysis.
